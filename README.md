## Compiling

To properly compile this file you'll need [Python](https://python.org) (if you care about the scripts), the [devkitpro toolchain](https://github.com/devkitpro/pacman) and [libnx](https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx)

- Python libs:

```
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
```

- Install necessary libraries for borealis:

```
(sudo) (dkp-)pacman -S switch-glfw switch-mesa switch-glm
```

- Download app icon

```
python3 scripts/dl_icon.py
```

- Finally run to build the homebrew:

```
make -j8
```


## Installation

[!!KEEP IN MIND THAT EDITING THE SAVE CAN LEAD YOU INTO A BAN, SO IT'S HEAVILY SUGGESTED TO NOT USE IT IF YOU'RE NOT BANNED!!]

1. Download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/CrustySean/SplatEditorNX/releases) page

2. Put the homebrew into "sdmc:/"


## Usage

3. Open a game and keep pressing the "R" button until hbmenu shows up (running the app trough hbmenu won't work!)

4. Launch SplatEditorNX (this may take some seconds as it has to download some images)

5. Pick the Splatoon 2 version you have installed

6. Edit whatever you like

7. Press "Y" to save the changes

8. In Settings tab you'll need to click "Inject Save" button and wait for it to be injected

9. Launch Splatoon 2

10. Enjoy!
